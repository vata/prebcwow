To avoid ver mismatch in case if user already has different ver of MySQL, this lib will be the only dll in project.
It is unmodified from MySQL 4.1.15 win32 release.
No need to include full MySql project into lud, because user can use MySQL for different tasks.
(but libmysql.lib uses (?) zlib. Maybe it will be needed to recompile libmysql.lib from mysql-4.1.15-win-src/libmysql/libmysql.dsp with our ver of zlib - we'll see)
