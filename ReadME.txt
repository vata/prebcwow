first of all "Hi"!!! :P

This is what Team-cr were working on since the last cracked wowemu released!

what is CrFusion?
CrFusion is a wow Emulator based on ludmilla src wich is based on wowd wich is based on team-python! also it got some usage of mangos src "<3"..

NO its not active anymore... the main dev just left up the project to join another one....

I would like to thank:

1-The "maindev" as he didn't want me to say his nick name...
2-The Whole Team-cr/section-8 CREWS
3-Blackstorm Crews. Long live ;)
4-MaNGOS team for the GREATLY work
5-Ludmilla team for the sweet ass src, keep on hitting an never care what ather projects opinion on you/your/team 
6-WoWD for the src as well and the good relationship 
7-Team-python for the base of this whole thing 

How Does it work?
You must have Micr0soft Visual Studio .NET 2003, compile the data in /depnew/make_Win32/ then click all the .bat files there!
it does support client 1.8.x we didn't got the time to update to the newest one.

I hope this help some groups out there.

Peace!
